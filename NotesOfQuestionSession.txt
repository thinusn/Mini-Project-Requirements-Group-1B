Tasks of the rounds{
	- Requirements (3 weeks)
	- Design (2 weeks)
	- Implementation (4 weeks)
	- Testing (1 week)
}


Be sure to prioritise

- Similiar system to Honey, Disussion board etc, but they do not have the bells and whistles that this one needs...

- Detailed Use cases is NB (pre and post conditions etc)

- Auto generated summary: 
	Cannot be fully automated. PC Cant know what is important, but a human can upvote. Basically what we said about the Reddit upvoting 
	system. Keep plugability in mind, for instance to be able to run a script to show only threads that are rated as helpful

- "Marks":
	
- Level posting:
	Post hierarchy. So, moderator choose which users can start threads and which users replies are rated higher than other's

- Post points:
	Users should be able to upvote posts in order for those posts to bubble up

- Plagiarism checker:
	Do an open Google search, if it hits, plagiarism occurrs. Exact match. This is low priority (Ms Pieterse).

- Statistical info:
	Whole idea of "appraisal". Ppl get promoted on their status, by other users' perception of how useful his contributes are.

- Status:
	Board specific. NOT over the entire forum.

- APIs:
	Allowed to use open source, APIs, etc.
- Tracking (point 2):
	VERY important. Global, user specific. For example: unread threads are bold, while read threads are not.

- Level Content:
	Depending on level, users can add more formatting to their posts. IE, a newbie can only post text, whilst a next level user can post 
	images.
- Social tagging:
	Way of categorizing things. Like Diggit. Like moderator tags on subreddits.

- Archive:
	Old threads are to be archived and accessable to curent users. Even when messages and threads are deleted, they must NOT be removed 
	from the database, so thread must be able to be restored. Users to be notified automatically when their post is deleted.

- Rank:
	Users can reach a certain rank where they can delete posts. This must be configurable, ie admin decides if this feature is active. 
	Users' ranks has an influence on the weight of their upvotes. Karma system. Spendable karma??

- Link:
	Users to come from CS website.

- Roles:
	Users to have different roles in different sub boards. Like how there are students and tutors in the CS undergrad portal.

- Guest users:
	Non members should be able to see posts. Need not keep track if certain guests read a post.

- Configurable:
	Users who creates a thread has more power in his own thread. Users can edit their own posts.

- Board creation:
	Policy to decide which user can create a "buzzspace".

- Registered for a course:
	Like current CS website, if a CS student is registered for the course, he is registered on the portal. Configurable.


What I deduce from this is that they basically want Reddit...
